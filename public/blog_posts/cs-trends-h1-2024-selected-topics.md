## Large Language Models

Have you heard of ChatGPT? If not, it's time to catch up with one of the fastest-growing tech products. Launched in November 2022, ChatGPT [amassed one million users in just five days](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/chatgpt-users). The name ChatGPT combines "chat" and "GPT," which stands for Generative Pretrained Transformer, indicating that you are interacting with a sophisticated machine learning model. While we will delve deeper into the concepts of **GPT** in another technical blog, for now, we will refer to this sophisticated and VERY _LARGE_ machine learning _model_ to imitate human _lanaguage_, commonly known as a **LLM**.

This ML model is trained on a vast corpus of digitized knowledge to generate text by [continuously determining the next word based on preceding words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_model) until a designated stop word is reached. There are [numerous models](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard) available, each with its strengths and weaknesses. The capabilities of this ML model are remarkable, including generating realistic [images](https://www.midjourney.com/home) and [videos](https://lumalabs.ai/dream-machine), composing [poetry](https://lil.law.harvard.edu/blog/2022/12/20/chatgpt-poems-and-secrets/), creating [music](https://suno.com/), writing [code](https://github.com/features/copilot), diagnosing [diseases](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.00164), predicting [protein structures](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10410766/), and even assisting in the development of targeted cancer treatments, all with a simple [prompt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering) given in human language. This variant of artificial intelligenc is supported and funded by investment in Big Technology Firms and venture capitalists from . As one of the most transformative technologies of our era, it influences various aspects of life, from macro-level geopolitical effects [^2] to micro-level interactions with our beloved devices, like smartphones [^3].

In the near future, it is likely that any text, image, or video you encounter on the internet or elsewhere will be partly or wholly generated by a machine learning model. Indeed, portions of this and other blogs on this website have been enhanced by such a chatbot. Despite the current excitement around Artificial Intelligence and its transformative potential, there are concerns about it leading to a scientific monoculture [^4] and the degradation of scientific inquiry [^5]. Although AI tools can objectively boost productivity, they may also result in reduced learning and understanding. If you always have an expert by your side, would you ever strive to become an expert yourself? This could lead to the proliferation of misinformation and job losses [^6] due to the risks associated with Artificial General Intelligence. Additionally, it may provide better tools for scammers to commit identity theft or impersonate loved ones over the phone, enable politicians to create targeted political propaganda, or allow terrorists to engineer dangerous biological materials. Another significant issue is the substantial energy consumption of this technology, which accelerates climate changeâ€”a major looming threat to humanity [^7]. Consequently, governments worldwide are racing to create long-term governance frameworks to research, develop, and commercialize this technology [^8].

As with any great technology it has its pros and cons. As long as the pros largely outweigh the cons, this technology should overall improve and uplift our lives, isn't it? For example, even though LLM take immense amount of energy to train, once trained they are super useful and can help in all sorts of tasks. It's much better to use a LLM to write faster and overall save time and energy [^9]. It's not AI that is going to take your job, but someone who knows how to use AI might [^10]. At the same time, LLMs bring tools of creativity accessible to each and everyone in the world as distribution and access to these tools becomes wider. If people accept this as the most useful tool[^11] created since the birth of a computer and internet or hate it[^12], only time will tell, but, the genie is surely out of the bottle and there's no putting it back.
